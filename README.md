## A collection of scripts and commands for analyzing diet from metabarcoding data

This is a repository for scripts or shell commands I use to analyze metabarcoding data. So far, scripts may only work interactively. But I hope to one day put some time into making them ammenable to a command line interface or semi-automated.
